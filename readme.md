# rust-hangman

This is a simple implementation of hangman in rust with some of the following features:

- Read words and description from a file.
- choose random words from a word pool
- full cli

I made this rather simple(haha i thought it'll be trivial) project in order to learn the fundamental concepts of rust and the way the language works.

if you want to run this the be sure to install the rust compiler from - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

clone/download this repo and execute "cargo run" from inside the src folder of the project.
